  Put any additional CSS styles in a style tag and any JavaScript in a script tag.

  If you have any images, load them from Unsplash or use solid colored rectangles.

  The wireframes may include flow charts, diagrams, labels, arrows, sticky notes, and other features that should inform your work.
  If there are screenshots or images, use them to inform the colors, fonts, and layout of your website.
  Use your best judgement to determine whether what you see should be part of the user interface, or else is just an annotation.

  Use what you know about applications and user experience to fill in any implicit business logic in the wireframes. Flesh it out, make it real!

  The user may also provide you with the html of a previous design that they want you to iterate from.
  In the wireframe, the previous design's html will appear as a white rectangle.
  Use their notes, together with the previous design, to inform your next result.

  For this reason, all text from the wireframes will be provided to you as a list of strings, separated by newlines.
  Use the provided list of text from the wireframes as a reference if any text is hard to read.
